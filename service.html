            <h2>Paradigm</h2>
            <p>Paradigm: Forging Model Men of Aggieland is a men's organization at Texas A&M that focuses
                on growing our members through Passion, Leadership, Altruism, Excellence and Enrichment.
                As part of our mission to be the Model Men of Aggieland, we do service in the Bryan-College Station 
                area year round. We also raise money for our philanthropy, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
                Last year we raised over $15,000 for LLS at our event Rock 'n Reels. This year we plan on going even 
                bigger and crushing that number. Learn more at <a href="https://www.paradigm-tamu.org">paradigm-tamu.org</a>

            <h2>SLAM</h2>
            <p>SLAM: Sophomores Leading And Motivating is a Sophomore Leadership Organization at Texas A&M,
                which aims to create a positive and engaging environment where students are able to 
                develop their leadership qualities in a variety of ways. SLAM participates in multiple service
                events every month which gives members the chance to give back to the community. This year I will
                be serving as a SLAM Fam Uncle, where I will get the chance to mentor a small group of Sophomores
                and help them get the most out of their time in SLAM. Learn more at <a href="https://www.tamuslam.org">tamuslam.org</a>

            <h2>Fish Camp</h2>
            <p>Texas A&M Fish Camp is a 3 day overnight camp which intends to welcome Freshman into the
                Aggie family, by teaching them about our rich culture and traditions. I served as a Fish Camp Counselor 
                as a Sophomore and it was an extremely rewarding experience. I got the chance to make some amazing friends
                and also gave Freshman the opportunity to get the most out of their college experience at Texas A&M.
