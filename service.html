            <h2>Paradigm</h2>
            <p>Paradigm: Forging Model Men of Aggieland is a men's organization at Texas A&M that focuses
                on growing our members through Passion, Leadership, Altruism, Excellence and Enrichment.
                As part of our mission to be the Model Men of Aggieland, we do service in the Bryan-College Station area
                year round. We also raise money for our philanthropy, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Last year we
                raised over $15,000 for LLS at our event Rock 'n Reels. This year we plan on going even bigger and
                crushing that number. My time in Paradigm has been incredibly rewarding. I have made some great friends
                and grown a lot in the time that I have spent there. If you like to learn more about Paradigm and the
                work that we do, go check out our website:

            <h2>SLAM</h2>
            <p>SLAM: Sophomores Leading And Motivating is a Sophomore Leadership Organization at Texas A&M, which aims
                to create a positive and engaging environment where students are able to develop their leadership
                qualities in a variety of ways. SLAM participates in multiple service events every month which gives
                members the chance to give back to the community. Participating in SLAM as a Sophomore gave me the
                chance to meet some great friends, grow as a leader, and give back to the community. As a Junior this
                year, I am very excited to continue being a part of SLAM as a SLAM Fam Uncle, where I will get the
                chance to mentor a small group of Sophomores and help them get the most out of Sophomore year in SLAM.
                If you are interesting hearing more about SLAM, please go take a look at our website: <a

            <h2>Fish Camp</h2>
            <p>Texas A&M Fish Camp is a 3 day overnight camp which intends to welcome Freshman into the
                Aggie family, by teaching them about our rich culture and traditions. I served as a Fish Camp Counselor
                after my Freshman year and it immediately changed my life. Fish Camp was the first organization that I
                got involved with and it gave me a huge opportunity to grow as a person. But most importantly, it
                allowed me to serve the next generation of Aggies by showing them what makes our university so great. If
                you are curious, you can learn more about Texas A&M Fish Camp here:
