            <h2>Tyler Technologies Internship</h2>
            <p>This past summer I had the privilege to work as a Software Development Intern at Tyler Technologies.
                During my time there I was able to work with a great team and work on software that positively impacts the public.
                I learned a plethora of skills, specifically in web development using .NET Core.

            <h2>Slack Attendance App</h2>
            <p>The Slack Attendance Tracker is an app that I have been developing on the side for the last few months
                with plans to have it deployed by the end of this year. My mission in developing this app is to streamline
                the process of taking attendance for any organization that uses Slack for communication. I achieve this by
                using the Slack API to allow users to create events and mark them as attended by reacting to an automated message.

            <h2>Y86 CPU</h2>
            <p>
                Y86 assembler language is a simplified version of X86. I designed a microprocessor from 
                                scratch in a circuit drawing software called Logisim. The processor is capable of running basic
                                scripts written in the Y86 assembler language. This project was my first taste of computer organization
                                and low level programming. This project proved to be very difficult but ended up being incredibly rewarding 
                                in the end.

            <h2>More Coming Soon</h2>
            <p>I am constantly thinking of new project ideas and working on something. This semester I have two large projects 
                which I will be getting to work on soon. I will update this page as soon as I have some more information on these projects.
